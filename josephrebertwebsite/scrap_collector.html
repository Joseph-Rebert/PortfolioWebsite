							<p>Ever since I was a kid, I've wanted to make a game, but boy did I not know what I was signing up for. I had to completely self-teach myself, coding, art, music, marketing, and learn how to ship a product with a clear goal. Learning all this took time since I
							was working a full-time job while doing this. I will say it was all worth it though! I saw people uploading videos of my game and actually enjoying it. The reviews were great, especially for a first game, and the money was nice as well haha. In the section below I will go in the nitty-gritty of the stats of the game.</p>
							<p>Total units distributed were 84,662 as of 08/03/2025, which resulted in a total earning for me of 178,500$. The game is currently sitting at a rating of 70% positive ratings. The total average playtime per session for a player is 87 mins, and total playtime per player is 278 mins. I began production of the game in April 2024 and released it in March 2025. The game was developed in Godot which uses GDScript as the coding language and It's pretty much the same as python!</p>
