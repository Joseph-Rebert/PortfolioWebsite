							<p>A first-person horror game set in an unsettling, liminal hotel environment where players navigate looping corridors, identify subtle anomalies, and push forward in an eerie race to reach their room before the building traps them forever. I developed this as a rapid development project, focusing on delivering a complete, polished experience within a condensed timeline. The goal was to experiment with quick prototyping, environmental storytelling, and tension-building mechanics, while testing how effectively I could scope, design, and release a playable game under time constraints. This project strengthened my ability to prioritize core features, iterate quickly, and maintain atmospheric consistency under tight deadlines.</p>
							<p>This game did not reach anywhere near the success of "Scrap Collector" but I learned a lot from it. I sold 82 units resulting in 199$ earned. Average playtime is 40 minutes. The game was made in "Unity" which uses C#.</p>
