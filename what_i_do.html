							<h1 class="major">What I Do</h1>
							<p>I’ve picked up a lot of software engineering skills by just diving into projects and figuring stuff out as I go. I know how to build full-stack web apps using React, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript on the front end, and I’ve worked with Python and Node.js on the back end. I’ve messed around with APIs, handled user input, and built some cool tools like a generative AI image app using the Hugging Face API.</p>
							<p>On the game dev side, I’ve used Unity (C#) and Godot (GDScript) to release full games on Steam, including stuff like inventory systems, combat mechanics, UI, and even procedural generation. I’ve also worked with version control (Git/GitHub), and I’m getting more comfortable with debugging and writing cleaner, reusable code.</p>
							<p>Most of what I know came from just building what I wanted to see exist — either by watching a ton of tutorials, reading docs, or breaking things until they worked. I also keep learning from online classes, coding challenges, and just trying out different frameworks or tools when a project calls for it.</p>
